Tekst:
At the very least, tea is a flavourful way of getting enough fluid into your body each day. On top of that, studies have shown teas can help protect your teeth and your heart
Tea bag
Water
Milk - Dairy/Plant-based (Optional)
Sugar/Honey (Optional)
Run the tap a little so the water's nicely aerated, and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour!
Pop a tea bag into your mug (always a big mug)
Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.
Tea needs time to unlock all its flavour, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its thing. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.
Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you'll make it bitter.
If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.
Enjoy!
